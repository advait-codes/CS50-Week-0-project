# CS50-Week-0-project
I am learning Harvard University CS50 program, and this is my first week 0 project

I basically had a prior experience with scratch (https://github.com/advait-codes/Black_and_White) So in this project I didn't put much efforts (Not reccommended if you are just starting ooff)

This is where i am taking the course (https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+CS50+X/home)
And here I made the project (scratch.mit.edu)
ðŸ“ŽThis is my project (https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1196766717)

Please try to comment on it, it will make my day.ðŸ’–ðŸ’–
Have a good dayðŸŒ¹ðŸŒ¹
